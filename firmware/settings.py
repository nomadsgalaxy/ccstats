# Persistent user settings — the single store behind every OPTIONS screen.
#
# One flat dict, flashed through badgeware's State API (/state/ccstats.json —
# device flash, NOT the read-only /system mount, so it survives reinstalls).
# load() runs once at boot; update() writes through immediately on change, so
# a setting is never lost to a battery pull. Consumers read with get() at
# draw/use time (never from-import a value — that freezes it at import time).
#
# Keys are config contract: they are written to flash, so renaming one orphans
# the stored value. Keep them stable once shipped (like names.py screen ids).
