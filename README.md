# ccstats

Self-hosted **Claude Code usage stats** — a pipeline that turns a user's Claude Code
sessions into pre-computed JSON feeds and firmware for a **Badgeware Tufty 2350** badge that displays the stats on a 320×240 LCD.
Also a multi-screen web dashboard, that can be used without the hardware device.

The badge does no aggregation: the server computes everything and serves finished JSON over
HTTPS; the badge (or the web dashboard) just draws it. **The server half runs perfectly well on
its own** — if you only want the web dashboard, you don't need a badge.

## How it works

A small badge sits on your desk and shows your Claude Code activity at a glance — a **live avatar
that reacts as you work** (working / idle / waiting), your **session and weekly usage limits** with
countdowns to the next reset, and a rack of stat screens you cycle through with the buttons. That
working / idle / waiting state is read on the server a couple of times a second by watching each
session's live network traffic to the Claude API together with its transcript — there's nothing to
instrument in your editor.

The badge does no number-crunching. Behind it, a **Linux server** runs the pipeline on a cron: it
scrapes your Claude Code session transcripts, computes the stats, and banks them in a durable
**SQLite ledger** — so your totals stay *all-time* even after Claude Code prunes old transcripts. The
finished numbers are served as JSON over token-gated HTTPS, and the badge just draws them.

It can also span **multiple machines** — say a workstation at home and a remote dev server. Each
extra machine ships its own per-session usage to the main server, which folds it into one combined
total, so your stats follow you wherever you run Claude Code.

Among the things it surfaces: your daily/weekly **rhythm** (when you actually work), **token usage**
(with a cache-free input+output lens), **words and characters typed**, prompt counts and streaks,
per-**project** and per-**tool** breakdowns, cost estimates, and optional head-to-head **competition**
against friends running the same pipeline. There are several **color palettes** and display options
(metric toggles, which screens show) to fit personal taste.

You don't need the hardware — the same feeds render in a **web dashboard** in the browser. So the
minimum is just a **Linux machine that runs Claude Code**; the **Badgeware Tufty 2350** badge is an
optional physical desk display on top.

## What's in here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `server/` | The stats pipeline (parser + all-time SQLite ledger + cost), the optional live/limits/competition monitors, nginx + systemd templates, and `deploy.sh`. Self-contained — set this up alone for a dashboard-only install. |
| `viewscreens/` | The web dashboard `/viewscreens` (HTML5 canvas, PicoGraphics-style). Served by the server; also the **design spec** the firmware is ported from. |
| `firmware/` | The MicroPython badge firmware (PicoGraphics). Fetches the JSON feeds and renders ~21 stat screens + a live avatar. |
| `tools/` | Badge toolchain — `install-app.py`, `enable-autoboot.py`, font builders, and the pre-commit leak scan (`tools/hooks/`). |
| `docs/` | `architecture.md`, `schema.md` (the JSON feed contract), `projects-layout.md` (adapting project discovery to your machine), `remote-fragment.md` (folding in another machine), `device-pitfalls.md`, `useful-notes.md`. |

## Hardware

- **[Badgeware Tufty 2350](https://badgewa.re/)** (RP2350, 320×240 IPS LCD, WiFi, PicoGraphics).
- A USB-C cable for flashing, config and charging. Not included with the Tufty.

## Set up the server

The fastest path: clone the repo on the server, open Claude Code in it, and say
**“read README.md and set it up.”** It investigates the box, generates a token, writes the
config, builds the ledger, and installs the cron + nginx (+ Let's Encrypt). Full playbook,
security notes, and the stats catalog are in **[`server/README.md`](server/README.md)**.
It's also possible to use on a local machine with just the web dashboard, or with a Badgeware Tufty over LAN.

Manual update later: `git pull && sudo ./server/deploy.sh` (code only — your config, token, and
ledger are never touched).

## Set up the badge

Prereq: a working server or local Linux machine (above) with the feed URL + access token.

1. **Flash MicroPython** once: hold BOOTSEL while plugging in → the board mounts as USB storage
   → copy the **Pimoroni Tufty 2350** MicroPython `.uf2` (the Pimoroni build includes
   `picographics`). After this, everything is over USB serial.
2. **Install the app:** `python tools/install-app.py` (needs `mpremote`; be in the `dialout`
   group). Then `python tools/enable-autoboot.py` so the badge launches ccstats on power-on.
3. **WiFi:** double-press RESET to enter USB disk mode and edit `/system/wifi.txt` (one network
   per two lines: SSID, then password; `#` comments; order = priority).
4. **Stats URL + token:** copy `firmware/secrets.example.py` to the device as `/secrets.py` (over
   serial) and fill in your server URL, access token, and display alias.

Or skip the manual steps: clone the repo, connect the badge over USB, open Claude Code here and
say **“read README.md and set up the badge.”**
The repo contain useful documents for Claude to read, so it should be a smooth setup.

## Making changes

- **Firmware:** before you touch fonts, input, drawing, or the installer, read
  **[`docs/device-pitfalls.md`](docs/device-pitfalls.md)**, which collects the hard-won platform
  gotchas (grid-exact fonts, input vs frame cost, the mount bridge, install/launch verification).
- **The web spec** (`viewscreens/`) is the canonical screen design the firmware mirrors — keep
  the two in agreement when changing screens.
- **Practical dev notes** — the firmware ↔ dashboard relationship, verifying a `/viewscreens` change
  with headless Chromium, and the `mpremote` badge dev loop — are in [`docs/useful-notes.md`](docs/useful-notes.md).
- **Hygiene:** enable the pre-commit leak scan once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks`.
